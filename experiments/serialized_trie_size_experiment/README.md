## Serialized Trie Size and Time Reading Experiment

### Description

This script runs a small experiment using the Princeton
Word Net database.

### Running Locally

TODO

There's the question of adding the correct paths to the `PYTHONPATH` variable and how to do that on different environments.

As it stands, the script can only be run locally within VS Code or with some work arounds with adding the root directory to one's `PYTHONPATH`
